# baseball-traits-for-higher-salaries
For this report we will be assessing the baseball data set, which addresses the 1986 salaries and performances of North American Major League Baseball players. The data set was obtained from the ASA 1988 Data Exposition, with the corrections and revisions incorporated. Our main objective is to determine the key performance drivers of baseball hitters and how they contribute to their salaries. For the purpose of our analysis, we will primarily be focusing on numerical variables and will be excluding most qualitative variables such as hitterâ€™s name, league, division and team, unless we find valid reasons to include them.
